Hello, As you know im String. This is my first Machine Learning project following the guide from "https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#python".
In this project, I am using the Iris flower dataset, which consists of measurements of various iris flowers. The goal is to predict the species of a flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data changing and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and performance metrics.
Matplotlib: For visualizing data and model performance.
SciPy: For additional scientific computing

If you want me to message me on anything about this project or have questions about me please message me on discord. String#0910
