Hello,
As you may know I am String. This is my first machine learning project, which follows the guide from Machine Learning Mastery.
In this project I use the Iris flower dataset, which includes measurements of various iris flowers. The goal is to predict the species of a flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and performance metrics.
Matplotlib: For visualizing data and model performance.
SciPy: For additional scientific computing.
If you have any questions about this project, please feel free to message me on discord: String#0910.
